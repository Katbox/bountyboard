# "bounty-board-devel" and "bounty-board-test" on your development
# machine. For a good set of instructions, see

# Warning: The database defined as "test" will be erased and
# re-generated from your development database when you run "rake".
# Do not set this db to the same as development or production.

  database: bounty-board-test
